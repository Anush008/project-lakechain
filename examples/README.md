# âš¡ Examples

In this section we've built different examples spanning a wide array of use-cases and middlewares. We strive to follow the eat-your-own-dog-food principle and build useful examples for every single middleware we build. The examples you will find here are fully documented and can be used as a starting point for your own projects using Project Lakechain.

They are organized in two different categories:

- [**Simple Pipelines**](./simple-pipelines): These examples are meant to be simple and easy to understand. They usually involve a restricted number of middlewares and are purposefully not very complex. They are a good starting point for new comers to Project Lakechain that want to get started quickly.
- [**End-to-End Use-Cases**](./end-to-end-use-cases): These examples involve more complex DAGs and showcase real-life end-to-end examples where Project Lakechain can be useful. They are a good reference for more advanced users that want to understand how to deploy complex pipelines.
