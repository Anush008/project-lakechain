# üé® Image Outpainting Pipeline

> In this example, we showcase how to leverage Amazon Bedrock and the Amazon Titan image model capabilities to perform image outpainting.

## ‚ùì What is Happening

Image outpainting refers to the process of replacing a portion of an image located outside of a contextual _mask_, with an AI generated image. In this example we show how to use a mask prompt to mask a _house_ in an input image, and replace the environment around the house with a _Beautiful garden and swimming pool_.

Below is an example of the result of the outpainting process executed by this example.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note that during the pipeline execution, the image will be resized to a 1024x1024 resolution with a [contain fit](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-resize) to match the input requirements of the Titan model.

To use this pipeline, simply upload images of a house to the input bucket, and the pipeline will automatically outpaint the image and upload the result to the output bucket. You can of course update the code of the pipeline to mask another type of object in the image.

## üìù Requirements

The following requirements are needed to deploy the infrastructure associated with this pipeline:

- You need access to a development AWS account.
- [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) is required to deploy the infrastructure.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is required to be running to build middlewares.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v20+ and NPM.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.8+ and [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## üöÄ Deploy

Head to the directory [`examples/simple-pipelines/generative-pipelines/image-outpainting-pipeline`](/examples/simple-pipelines/generative-pipelines/image-outpainting-pipeline) in the repository and run the following commands to build the example:

```bash
npm install
npm run build-pkg
```

You can then deploy the example to your account (ensure your AWS CDK is configured with the appropriate AWS credentials and AWS region):

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## üßπ Clean up

Don't forget to clean up the resources created by this example by running the following command:

```bash
npm run destroy
```
