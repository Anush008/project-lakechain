# üñºÔ∏è Bedrock Multimodal Pipeline

> In this example, we showcase how to create vector embeddings for image documents using the [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) Titan image embedding model. The embeddings are stored within a [LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/) embedded database that you can query using your own applications.

## üìù Requirements

The following requirements are needed to deploy the infrastructure associated with this pipeline:

- You need access to a development AWS account.
- You also need a Pinecone API key.
- [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) is required to deploy the infrastructure.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is required to be running to build middlewares.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v20+ and NPM.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.8+ and [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## üöÄ Deploy

Head to the directory [`examples/simple-pipelines/embedding-pipelines/bedrock-multimodal-pipeline`](/examples/simple-pipelines/embedding-pipelines/bedrock-multimodal-pipeline) in the repository and run the following commands to build the example:

```bash
npm install
npm run build-pkg
```

You can then deploy the example to your account (ensure your AWS CDK is configured with the appropriate AWS credentials and AWS region):

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## üßπ Clean up

Don't forget to clean up the resources created by this example by running the following command:

```bash
npm run destroy
```
