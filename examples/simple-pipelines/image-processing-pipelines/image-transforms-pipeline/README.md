# üñºÔ∏è Image Transforms Pipeline

> In this example, we show how to use the Sharp Image Processor middleware to apply transformations to images at scale, such as resize, rotation, and format conversion operations.

## :dna: Pipeline

```

## ‚ùì What is Happening

The Sharp Image processor middleware is based on the [`Sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library which provides a very efficient way to apply transformations to images using [`libvips`](https://www.libvips.org/). It is an ideal fit for a serverless workloads running in a Lambda environment where resources are constrained, and transform operations need to be very fast.

This example showcases how you can use the Sharp library at scale within a Lakechain pipeline, and demonstrates how to describe the transformations you want to apply to your images using an API that is close to the original Sharp API.

Below are some of the supported transformations that you can run as part of your pipeline:

- Image resize, flip, flop
- Image rotation
- Image format conversion (PNG, JPEG, Webp, Gif, Avif, etc.)
- Image color transformations (grayscale, gamma, negate, tint, etc.)
- Image blurring and sharpening

## üìù Requirements

The following requirements are needed to deploy the infrastructure associated with this pipeline:

- You need access to a development AWS account.
- [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) is required to deploy the infrastructure.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is required to be running to build middlewares.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v18+ and NPM.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v3.8+ and [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## üöÄ Deploy

Head to the directory [`examples/simple-pipelines/image-transforms-pipeline`](/examples/simple-pipelines/image-transforms-pipeline) in the repository and run the following commands to build the example:

```bash
npm install
npm run build-pkg
```

You can then deploy the example to your account (ensure your AWS CDK is configured with the appropriate AWS credentials and AWS region):

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## üßπ Clean up

Don't forget to clean up the resources created by this example by running the following command:

```bash
npm run destroy
```
