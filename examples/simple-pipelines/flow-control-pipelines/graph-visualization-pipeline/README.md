# :blue_book: Graph Visualization Pipeline

> This example showcases how to use the DAG `Renderer` to visualize a Lakechain pipeline.

## :dna: Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S3[S3 Trigger] --> PDF[PDF Text Converter]
  S3[S3 Trigger] --> Pandoc[Pandoc Text Converter]
  S3[S3 Trigger] --> Keybert[Keybert Text Processor]
  PDF --> Keybert
  Pandoc --> Keybert
  Keybert --> Storage[S3 Storage Connector]
```

## ‚ùì What is Happening

In this example, we are laying out a simple topic modeling pipeline for text documents leveraging the Keybert text processor middleware.

We use the `DagRenderer` component to create a visual representation of the pipeline. This can come in handy when building complex pipelines and you want to visualize the pipeline to ensure that it is correct.

```bash
import { DagRenderer, MermaidRenderer } from '@project-lakechain/core/renderer';

// Creating the DAG renderer.
const renderer = new DagRenderer({
  engine: new MermaidRenderer()
});

// Rendering the pipeline with the given middlewares.
renderer.render([
  // List of middlewares.
]);
```

In the stack associated with this example, we use the [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) rendering engine to render the pipeline into an SVG image that can be seen on the deployment machine. The rendered diagrams look as follow.

As the goal of this pipeline is less to deploy it, but more to showcase the visualization capabilities of the `DagRenderer`, we will not deploy this pipeline. However, you can synthesize the stack to get a link to the rendered diagram.

The link to the generated diagram is printed to `stderr`, so you can isolate it by running the following command.

```bash
npm run synth 2> output.txt
```

You can then read the content of the `output.txt` file to find the link to the diagram.
