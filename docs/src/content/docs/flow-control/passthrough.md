The Passthrough middleware acts, as its name implies, as a passthrough for document events. Its main purpose is to log document events and their associated metadata.

---

### ‚û°Ô∏è Logging Events

To use this middleware, you import it in your CDK stack and instantiate it as part of a pipeline.

```typescript
import { Passthrough } from '@project-lakechain/passthrough';
import { CacheStorage } from '@project-lakechain/core';

class Stack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string) {
    // The cache storage.
    const cache = new CacheStorage(this, 'Cache');
    
    // The passthrough middleware.
    const passthrough = new Passthrough.Builder()
      .withScope(this)
      .withIdentifier('Passthrough')
      .withCacheStorage(cache)
      .withSource(source) // üëà Specify a data source
      .build();
  }
}
```

#### Resolving Metadata

As seen in the [Events](/core/events) section, metadata associated with a document event can contain [Pointers](/core/events#using-pointers) to other documents. You can configure the Passthrough middleware to resolve those pointers and log their value in CloudWatch logs for debugging purposes.

```typescript
const passthrough = new Passthrough.Builder()
  .withScope(this)
  .withIdentifier('Passthrough')
  .withCacheStorage(cache)
  .withSource(source)
  .withResolveMetadata(true)
  .build();
```

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Passthrough middleware executes within a Lambda compute, consumes input events, logs their information to AWS CloudWatch Logs and passes through the events to the next middlewares in the pipeline.
