The Syndication feed parser makes it possible to parse [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) and [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)) feeds from upstream documents, extract each feed item from the feeds, and forward them, along with their metadata to other middlewares in the pipeline.

---

### üì∞ Parsing Feeds

To use this middleware, you import it in your CDK stack and instantiate it as part of a pipeline.

```typescript
import { SyndicationFeedProcessor } from '@project-lakechain/syndication-feed-processor';
import { CacheStorage } from '@project-lakechain/core';

class Stack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string) {
    const cache = new CacheStorage(this, 'Cache');
    
    // Create the syndication feed processor.
    const syndicationProcessor = new SyndicationFeedProcessor.Builder()
      .withScope(this)
      .withIdentifier('SyndicationProcessor')
      .withCacheStorage(cache)
      .withSource(source) // üëà Specify a data source
      .build();
  }
}
```

### üìù Metadata

This middleware will automatically extract feed item metadata and make them available as part of the output [CloudEvents](/project-lakechain/general/events). The following metadata are extracted, when available, from feed items.

| Metadata      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `title`       | The title of the feed item. |
| `description` | The description of the feed item. |
| `createdAt`   | The creation date of the feed item. |
| `updatedAt`   | The last update date of the feed item. |
| `authors`      | The authors associated with the feed item. |
| `keywords`    | The keywords associated with the feed item. |
| `language`    | The language of the feed item. |

<br>

### üìÑ Output

This middleware takes as an input RSS or Atom syndication feeds, and outputs *multiple* HTML documents that are associated with each extracted feeds. This makes it possible for downstream middlewares to process each HTML document that is part of the original feed in parallel.

Below is an example of an output HTML document extracted from a feed item by the syndication feed processor.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Limits

This middleware will not attempt to request via HTTP the feed items to compute their size. Therefore, the `size` property on the document event for feed items is not specified on output events.

Another limitation lies in that this middleware only outputs HTML documents, and does not currently forward [RSS Enclosures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_enclosure) to downstream middlewares (e.g associated images or video documents).

<br>

---

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This middleware is based on a Lambda compute using the [`feedparser`](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/) Python library to parse the feeds and extract the feed items.
