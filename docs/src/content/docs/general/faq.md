##### What is Project Lakechain?

Project Lakechain is a framework allowing AWS customers develop and deploy scalable and resilient document processing pipelines on AWS. Project Lakechain is built on top of the [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), allowing customers to express their pipelines as infrastructure-as-code and follow best-practices of consistent, repeatable, auditable and versioned infrastructure.

With Lakechain, developers can compose their pipelines using [middlewares](/project-lakechain/general/concepts#-middlewares), and model them in the shape of a [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).

##### What's different about Project Lakechain?

Project Lakechain has been built on top of a cloud-native architecture with scale, security and cost-efficiency in mind since the very beginning. It leverages a strong foundation for high-throughput message-passing based on AWS SQS and AWS SNS, and a [security model](/project-lakechain/guides/security-model) based on AWS IAM to keep customer data secure and private.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è See the [Architecture Overview](/project-lakechain/guides/architecture) section for more details on the architecture of Lakechain.

By providing dozens of existing middlewares, built for the Cloud, and addressing the most common needs for processing documents using Machine-Learning, Generative AI, NLP, and Computer Vision, Project Lakechain provides an ideal blueprint for rapid prototyping and validation of ideas.

##### Who is Project Lakechain for?

The primary audience for Project Lakechain are all developers within a Cloud, DevOps or Data-Science team looking to deploy scalable document processing pipelines on AWS using the AWS CDK.

> üíÅ Project Lakechain assumes a good understanding of the AWS CDK concepts by developers. If you are new to the AWS CDK, we recommend you start by reading the [AWS CDK Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).

##### Is Project Lakechain production-ready?

No, Project Lakechain is currently not intended for production-use. It is intended for rapid prototyping and experimentation only. It can however serve as an excellent blueprint of how production-ready pipelines could look like for customers looking to build their own.

##### What are the requirements to use Project Lakechain?

You can find the technical requirements for using Project Lakechain in the [Pre-requisites](/project-lakechain/general/pre-requisites) section of the documentation.

<br />

---

##### Where can I find examples of pipelines?

You can find all the examples we've built for developers in the [Examples](https://github.com/awslabs/project-lakechain/tree/main/examples) directory of the Project Lakechain GitHub repository.

##### In what language is Project Lakechain written?

As of today, Project Lakechain is available to all users using the AWS CDK in TypeScript. We are working on adding support for other languages in the future.

<br />

---

##### In what language are middlewares written?

While the code describing the infrastructure implemented by each middleware is written in TypeScript using the AWS CDK, the logic executed at runtime during a pipeline execution (Lambda functions, Docker containers, etc.) can be written in any language.

##### Can I write my own middlewares?

Yes, we are currently working on a developer handbook to help you write your own middlewares. Stay tuned!
