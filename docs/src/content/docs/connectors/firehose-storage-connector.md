The Firehose storage connector makes it possible to forward [CloudEvents](/project-lakechain/general/events) emitted by one or multiple middlewares in a pipeline to a user-defined Kinesis Firehose delivery stream. This connector allows to nicely decouple the processing of your documents with third-party applications that can consume processed documents from a delivery stream.

> üíÅ This connector only forwards the CloudEvents emitted by middlewares to the delivery stream, and not the documents themselves.

### ‚è≥ Buffering Documents

To use the Firehose storage connector, you import it in your CDK stack, and connect it to a data source providing documents.

```typescript
import { FirehoseStorageConnector } from '@project-lakechain/firehose-storage-connector';
import { CacheStorage } from '@project-lakechain/core';

class Stack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string) {
    // The cache storage.
    const cache = new CacheStorage(this, 'Cache');

    // The destination delivery stream.
    const stream = // ...

    // Create the Firehose storage connector.
    const connector = new FirehoseStorageConnector.Builder()
      .withScope(this)
      .withIdentifier('FirehoseStorageConnector')
      .withCacheStorage(cache)
      .withSource(source) // üëà Specify a data source
      .withDestinationStream(stream)
      .build();
  }
}
```

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This middleware makes use of the native integration between the SNS output topics of source middlewares with Kinesis Firehose to forward messages to a delivery stream, without relying on any additional compute resources.
